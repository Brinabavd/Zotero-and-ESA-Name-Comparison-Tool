## This code was created on July 28th, 2023 by Emmett Kliger and Arin Jaff
## This code implements the Zotero API and the Crossref REST API.

## This code serves a few purposes:

##First, it can fully extract zotero creator information from a zotero library 
## and export citation information to a .csv file.  Subcollections information is included.
## This output comes in zotero_creators.csv.

## Second, it can extract information from a spreadsheet and export it to a .csv.
## We used this to convert a large manually entered dataset from excel into a more easily
## readable form, while also eliminating duplicates/mispelled words with find_mispellings().
## (You can lower/raise the sensitivity of this spellcheck by altering the levenshtein global threshold) 
## You should check that this code can handle the formatting of your spreadsheet by looking 
## at the esa_name_combiner() function and the names of the spreadsheet column titles it reads in.
## The easiest solution is to change the name of the columns on your spreadsheet, but edit the
## code as needed for your spreadsheet. Check ~line 250 for this information.
## Output is lablelled esa_names.csv

## Third, this code can comb through the excel spreadsheet's authors from the resulting .csv, 
## and can extract the DOI information from them. This is useful for citing papers we did not
## already have in our zotero library that were in our excel database. Note that this uses the 
## Crossref REST API, and if you are combing through presentations like we did, there will need to
## be a great similarity between the name referenced and the logged name of the presentation.
## To account for some mispellings, we used another levenshtein global threshold which can be 
## changed, but as you raise it and lower the sensitivtiy of checking you may allow more incorrect
## DOIs to be collected with similar keywords. This also occasionally runs into retry errors, which
## is accounted for in make_request_with_retry().
## output is labelled dois_names.csv


## Finally, this can compare the two sources' information to check for overlap between the two.
## We used this to find overlap in authors that we had cited in our large spreadsheet
## With authors that we had in our zotero library. The output is a .csv file labelled 
## citation_checker.csv

## -- IMPORTANT CHANGES TO MAKE FOR YOUR RUNNING --

## You may need to check the directories referenced to make sure they are valid with your names,
## and use an absolute path rather than relative if you run into trouble.

## Request your own Zotero API Key from https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys, and adjust
## the settings to your library as needed. If you run into errors, the permissions may be
## the reason why.

## You can find your zotero library/sublibrary IDs by checking the web URL when you open your library

## Doi Scraping is currently commented out at the bottom of this code. This is because it takes an 
## EXTREMELY long time to run, and we recommend you only do this once when you are fully ready and 
## are sure that your data works with the other steps we have in our code.

## For DOI scraping, replace your email with the placeholder youremail@youremail.com. This will place
## you on Crossref's polite user list and you will have faster/better/consistent access to their api.
